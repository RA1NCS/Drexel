DELAYED EXTRA CREDIT:
Okay so honestly, I do NOT know much about compilers compiling in their own language, but a few months ago, I did read about bootstrapping 
while on a call with my friend, who explained to me that it was essentially that compilers can be written in the same language that they are 
compiling, but the issue is that, for compiling the compiler, you will have to use the compiler of another language. That is all I know about
the topic. Coming back to the topic, I'd say that they are wrong, because languages which are written in their own languages exist, for example Java
or C.

I know that my answer is probably insufficient, but I really hope this gets me the final extra question deduction :)
